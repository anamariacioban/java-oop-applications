# Java OOP Applications

Collection of Java applications developed as part of academic coursework, focused on object-oriented programming principles and software design.

## Technologies
- Java
- Maven
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Git

## Project Structure
The repository contains multiple independent Java projects, each structured as a standard Maven application:

/isp-lab-X/
- src/
- pom.xml
- README.md

Each project demonstrates:
- OOP concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Modular design
- Clean project structure using Maven
- Version control using Git

## Purpose
These projects were developed to strengthen practical understanding of software architecture, project structure, and object-oriented design in Java.
